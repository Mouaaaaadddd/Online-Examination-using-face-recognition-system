## 📝 Project Overview

This project is an **AI-powered online MCQ examination system**. Users can answer questions **without using hands, keyboard, or mouse**. This makes it ideal for those who face physical challenges.

The system utilizes:

* **Face Mesh Tracking** (MediaPipe)
* **Nose landmark detection**
* **Head movement gestures**
* **Flask backend**
* **HTML + CSS + JavaScript UI**

It is designed for **paralysed individuals, amputees, motor-disabled users**, or patients who cannot physically write exams.

## 🤖 How It Works

The camera tracks the user’s **nose position** using MediaPipe. Each direction represents an answer:

| Head Movement | Detected As | Meaning  |
| ------------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Head Up       | A           | Option A |
| Head Down     | B           | Option B |
| Head Left     | C           | Option C |
| Head Right    | D           | Option D |

This gesture-based system allows users to select answers through natural head movements.

## 🎓 Using the Application

1. **Start the Examination**

   Once you have set up your profile, click on "Start Exam" in the main menu. The system will load a set of multiple-choice questions.

2. **Answering Questions**
   
   - Read each question carefully.
   - Use your head movements to select your answer.
   - The application will automatically register your response based on your gesture.

3. **Completing the Exam**

   After answering all questions, click "Submit." The system will display your results immediately.

## 💡 Tips for Effective Use

- Ensure good lighting in the room for better camera tracking.
- Practice your gestures before the actual exam to increase accuracy.
- Use headphones for a clearer audio experience if the exam includes oral questions.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, consider the following solutions:

- **Camera Not Detected:** Ensure your camera is connected and recognized by the operating system.
- **Poor Gesture Recognition:** Make sure you are positioned well and the camera can see your movements clearly. Recalibrate if necessary.
- **App Crashes or Errors:** Restart the application and try again. If the problem persists, reinstall the application.
